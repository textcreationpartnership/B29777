            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Short Christian RULES.</head>
            <p n="1">I. DEfer not your Conversion, or the performance of any Good Action, till the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for the Morrow is uncertain, but Death is ever certain. Grace will Assist, where Man doth not Resist.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Defer not your Conversion, or the Performance of any Good Action, to your Old Age, but offer to God the Flower of your Youth: Uncertain is Old Age to the Young, but certain Destruction attends him that Dies Young without Repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">III. While you Live, Die daily to your Self, and to your Vices; so in Death may you expect to Live to God: You cannot Live to him, but according to the Measure as you are Dead to the Flesh.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Commit not an Evil Action for the sake of any Man, for that Man whom you so much Respect, will not be your Judge.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Examine your Life every Day, whether you Increase or Decrease, in Charity, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Purity: Consider how in the Way of the Lord, you must either Increase or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. To stand herein is to go back; stand not therefore but walk in the way of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Consider these Three Things Past, the Evil you have Committed, the Good you have Omitted, and the Time you have Mis-spent.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Consider these Three Things Present, the Shortness of this Life, the Difficulty of being Born a-new by the Spirit, and the Smalness of Christ's Flock.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Consider these Three Things to Come, <hi>Death,</hi> than which Nothing is more Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unless you take out its Sting; <hi>Judgment,</hi> than which Nothing can be more Terrible, unless you Judge your Self before▪ <hi>Hell,</hi> than which Nothing can be more Intolerable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you Quench the Fire of it Kindled in your Breast.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Three Times there are which you must not lose; when you see any one do a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Deed, you must not be Careless of Learning to Practice it; whenever an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of doing a Good Action presents it self, catch it fast, let it not slip for all the World; whenever an Occasion of doing Ill presents it self, guard your self with the fear of God, and lose not a Triumph.</p>
            <p n="10">X. God has Communicated himself wholly to you; do you Communicate your Self wholly to your Neighbour: And when you do any thing for another, do it with the same Zeal as if you did it for your Self.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That's the Best Life which is wholly Imploy'd to the Benefit of others: Esteem not of Life any further than as it is serviceable and useful to the World.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Think not with your Self what you have, but rather what you want. Be not Proud for what you have received, but be Humble for what you have abused.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Whatever you desire to have, ask it of God: Whatever you have already, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it wholly to God. As soon as you begin to find Nothing in your Self, you shall begin to find all Things in God.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Withdraw your Self while you can, and as much as you can from the World: As far as you are withdrawn from it, so much nearer are you drawn to God.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Look not on Religion as a System of Orthodox Notions, or as a Rubrick of Forms, much less as a Charm laid to draw such and such Sinners into Heaven, but as an Inward Spirit, or Life, which enlivens and governs the true Christian, in performance of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is suitable to his high Birth and Condition.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Give not the least Quarter to any Corrupt Affection; lest a Spark break out into a Fire, and consume you before you are aware: Above all thing, take heed not to Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate your Vices, or to Hallow the Corruptions of the Satanical Life, taking them for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Graces. Christen not that Holy Zeal, which is Bitter Wrath; or that Christian Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, which is Sullenness or Pride; or that Humility, which is Cowardice; or that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which is an Affront offer'd to Superiours.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Take Care that you be not found in the Root and Principle of Hell, if you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of its Flames: Take Care that you be found in the Root and Principle of Heaven, if you expect to partake of its Joys. Be sure to try your Root, and let not <hi>Luciser</hi> in you, transform himself into an Angel of Light.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Use your Self to think on God as always Present; thus thinking on him, you will in some sort behold him; thus beholding him, you will become Like to him.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Render your Self worthy of Him who has vouchsafed for to own you for his Child; and remember in all your Deeds, that you have God for your Father. Never forget the High Character you bear.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. Begin every Thing that you do with God; End every Thing with him; and let the Thought of him and his Name, be as Familiar and Natural to you as your Breathing.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. Strive To be, what you would be thought to be: As you desire to appear in the Day of Judgment, so appear at this present in the sight of God. Strive to be Great in Him, and Great in your Self: Strive to be greater than what you appear to others: Let the World be deceiv'd no otherwise in you, than they are in the Stars of Heaven.</p>
